## Proof of Python Programming

This repository contains 2 Python projects as an attempt to provide proof of python programming skills. 

### 1. Blackjack Game
A command-line Blackjack game, built as a basic demonstration of **Object Oriented Programming** in Python. 

Implements card dealing, scoring, and game logic with Python classes.

The game is available in the directory: *BlackJack/BlackJack.py*

### 2. SDSS Object Classification
